GIT - A program that users can install that relies on and recieves information from GitHub. Git allows users to view and edit source code.

GITHUB - Similiar to Git, GitHub is a website that users who have installed Git can use to download updates and apply them to Git. Users can upload and work on projects together with other members.

Repository - Similiar to a folder on your desktop, the repository stores all files pertaining to the program and allows all users to have access to the files and edit them. 

Clone - A term that allows a user to take an existing repository and copy it to a new location. In Git, the Clone option can be found in the sidebar.

Commit - A version of each save that is made to a file. The commit has it own ID and users can leave a message noting what was added or removed from the file.

Push - After a commit is made, a push is made to a repository so all users contributing to the project can see the updated information. A push takes the commit from your local machine is puts it on the server. 

Pull - Makes all commits and changes up to do, regardless of who is working on the project at any time. This ensures that the file is up to date on the local repository.

Branch - An individual link that is assigned to each user that is working on the project. These branches allow multiple users to work on their own at the same time, however they all get saved to the Master Branch, which is the main branch with all the changes merged together.

Merge - After users have finished with their work, the changes to the file all get combined into the Master Branch so that there is one complete file with all edits from the team. 

Merge Conflict - This happens when two users coincidentally edit the same line of a file and save it, or if someone deletes a file that another user is working on. These conflicts must be fixed before a pull can happen.

Fetch - Similiar to a pull, it gathers new information from a repository but doesn't merge them. Instead, it allows the users to view the new information and compare it to their work on their local machine.

Remote - A repository on GitHub where users push and pull information from that shows the version of the file.
